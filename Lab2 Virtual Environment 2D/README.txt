# Project Description

DaNauâ€™s Virtual Chat is a 2D chat application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL Databases. Users can join a virtual chat room created by Canvas, which is connected to our custom-built server, or change to a new room, to send messages to all users in the shared environment and interact with their avatars within the virtual space.

# How It Works

The chat application uses our own Server called myServerClean.js. Users can join the Virtual World by either logging in with their existing credentials or registering as a new user on the initial page. User data is stored in an external database, allowing us to keep track of all registered users. Upon successful login or registration, users are connected to the main hall room. Here, they can interact with other users in the Virtual room by sending messages and storing them in the Database. The list of currently connected users can be viewed by clicking on the Users button. Users also have the option to choose a new avatar character using the Avatar button. In the hall, users can navigate the room by clicking on their desired destination. If a user is in front of a door, they can enter the corresponding room by clicking the up arrow. Once in the new room, they can navigate to the left to return to the hall or navigate to the right into a new established room.

Moreover, users can reconnect to the application by refreshing the web page and will be placed in the last room they joined, at the central point. This allows for smooth and continuous navigation between the different rooms.
Our DaNau's chat application is a dynamic and interactive environment for users to communicate and engage with each other in various created Virtual spaces.
