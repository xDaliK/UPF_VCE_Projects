# Project Description

DaNau’s Virtual Classroom is a 3D communicative environment developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL Databases. Users can join a virtual 3D classroom, which is connected to our custom-built server, where Students and Teachers can interact in various ways: they can send messages, speak, carry out activities, and also interact with the characters of other students and teachers within the Virtual 3D Classroom.

# How It Works

The chat application uses our own Server called myServer.js. Users can join the Virtual 3D World by either logging in with their existing credentials or registering as a new user on the initial page. Registering, you have the option to choose between two modes: one for students and another for teachers. Each role has available rendered characters that are displayed during the registration process. User data is stored in an external database, allowing us to keep track of all registered users. 

Upon successful login or registration, users are connected to the general Classroom. Inside the classroom, students and teachers can interact to enhance the Virtual Classroom Experience:


·Interaction with Students:
- Movement: "W","A","S", "D", and with the mouse to control the pointing camera.
- Sit: "Control", near an available chair -> Press "Escape" to show the cursor on the screen.
- Raise Hand: "Q", once the student is seated in a chair to ask a question.
- Change to global camera: "Right Click Mouse", once the student is seated in a chair.
- Change distance from Blackboard: "Scroll mouse Up/Down", once the student is seated in a chair.
- Chat Interaction: "C", to show/hide the chat application where we can send messages to the class.
- Microphone Interaction: "T", to talk/not talk with a microphone within the class.
- Show/Hide Users Names: "N", to show/hide the users banners of their names.
- Stop writting: "Escape", to stop when you are typing and enable all the features again.
- Confirm activity: "Left Click", on the Press Button to confirm our activity in class. Initially, the button is green, indicating that the user is active. 
If a user does not show activity after a certain period, their banner will turn red notifying all the class that this student is not paying attention. 
- Answer question: "Left Click", when the exercise paper is displayed to the student in the "Respuesta" section. 

- HUD: available buttons for Students -> Show/Hide Users Names, Chat Interaction and Microphone Interaction.
